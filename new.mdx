title: New Round

### Create

When you're ready to raise capital, you'll start by creating a new round inside the Fundraise tab. Think of this as setting the “term sheet” for your personal token. You define two key variables that together establish the economics of the offering:

1. **Target amount (USDC)**: the total capital you want to raise in this round. Must be greater than 5000 USD.
2. **Price per share (USDC)**: determined by what you want your personal token valuation to be. _(If you're confused about how to [determine the valuation](/questions/valuation), we'll help you think it through. In some cases, the valuation will be determined by an investor you're looking to raise from.)_

Auto-calculated: **Number of shares to sell** (the number of new shares that will be minted and issued).

Your round is considered "active" after you've created it, until is has been completed or canceled.
