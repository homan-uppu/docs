title: Sufficient Decentralization
---

Given the long-term nature of the underlying asset (personal tokens), this system needs to be implemented in a way that stands the test of time. Investments made today must be preserved centuries into the future. This isn't just nice-to-have, it's critically important for the success of this idea because without a sufficient guarantee of longetivity, most people wouldn't even participate (would you buy a home if you didn't think it would be around in 10 years?).

We can only succeed with sufficient decentralization. The failure of this company or team shouldn't take the entire system with it.

The purpose of this page is to make clear our intention and high level ideas for how we will achieve sufficient decentralization (and progressively increase degree of decentralization). We'll publish a much more detailed plan when the time is right. (_[Reach out](https://x.com/homanspirit) if you want to help._)

## Organizational structure

We will bring this idea to the world through two distinct entities: a non-profit foundation and a for-profit [public-benefit-company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation).

### 1. The Foundation

(Delaware non-stock, public-benefit corporation (non-profit)).

The Foundation owns and governs the underlying technical protocol, the ledger (information about who contains how much of which personal tokens), and the [Network Token](/network-token) & the capital that the Network Token accrues in its wallet via the [equity fees](/fees#equity-fee). The Network Token's wallet is treated as the Foundation's treasury.

As the Net scales to the world, this Network Token will eventually represent all of humanity's potential. It's critically important we design the Foundation thoughtfully and progressively decentralize its own governance to make it resilient to individual insanity.

### 2. The Company

(Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)).

The Company will be the interface between the Net and the real world by complying with all laws and regulations, and ensuring off-Net activity (relevant to personal tokens) is reflected on-Net (e.g. [reporting capital gains](/reporting-capital-gains)).

In addition to this, the Company will create what's needed to create a thriving ecosystem of users investing in each other. This will likely include:

- Admission & identity. (ensuring each personal token owner meets requirements and verifies identity).
- Reputation. (penalizing)
- Applications (that connect users to the Net).
- Customer support
- Ban (and / or freeze) bad actors.
- Discovery.

Of course, not all of these functions will exist on day 1. The Company will operate like a hungry startup: building as little as required to get traction and grow.

## Transparency & competition

Yes, the Company has a lot of power at the start in order to bring this idea to the world as swiftly as possible. But, the underlying set up still has a key advantage: transparency. Any move the Company makes is recorded on-chain. For example, the Company can't just ban users without everyone knowing. And therefore won't be able to be too mis-aligned with how users want to use the Net.

And, in the case that users aren't happy with how the Company is operating (or even any function of the Company), they can always create their own companies / organizations to operate on top of the Net to compete with the Company (or some of its functions). For example, a competiting team can focus purely on building the best reputation system, or application (client) that connects to the Net, or a discovery engine to connect individuals and investors, etc.

By opening ourselves up to such competition at the foundational level will help hold us accountable to help manifest this idea in the way that the world wants. If we begin to deviate too much from what people want, or let things get to our heads, users will (and should) have the option to switch to different providers that operate on the same Net.

It will be the Foundation's responsibility to ensure an easy path for competitors to participate as operators on top of the Net, **even if that means competition for the Company**.
