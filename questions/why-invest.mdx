title: Why invest in personal tokens?
---

Why invest in someone's personal token instead of, say, their company?

Investing in an individual's personal token is different from investing in their company because you can:

1. Invest in them earlier: even before they may have an idea for a company to start or join.
2. Bet on an individual more broadly: across all of their investments and creations as opposed to a single idea.
3. Bet on an individual over the course of their lives, not just for the duration of a single idea.
