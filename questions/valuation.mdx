title: How is valuation determined?
---

Part art. Part science. Part convention.

The "art" is in the narrative you build around yourself — your track record, potential, credibility, and influence within the Network. Just like startups, people can be early bets or proven value, and investors would weigh things like vision, talent, and social capital when deciding what you're worth.

The "science" involves looking at your portfolio: your equities in companies and other personal tokens, your investment history. Investors may model your growth based on the performance of your assets and your track record in the Network — like a personal balance sheet in motion.

The "convention" is whatever the Network agrees to treat as valuable. There's no universal formula, so norms evolve: some tokens might trade based on recent wins, others on reputation or how diversified your holdings are.

Valuation is not a fixed number — it's a negotiated truth.
