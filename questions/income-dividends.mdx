title: Is income also distributed to shareholders?
---

NO. Personal tokens don't touch income or any other personal assets. The only assets a personal token represents is your equities in companies and other personal tokens.

Your personal token shareholders **only** receive dividends when you sell equity in a company / personal token.

Your income is **never** touched.
