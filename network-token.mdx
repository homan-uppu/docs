title: Network Token
---

At its heart, the Network Token is an index that represents the potential of every citizen of the Net, by capturing a tiny fraction of every personal token that successfully raises capital. Owning shares in the Network Token is a bet on the collective potential of everyone in the Net.

### How does the Network Token capture value?

Every time an individual raises funds through their personal token on the Net, a modest fraction of newly issued shares—just 0.1%—is automatically allocated to the Network Token treasury. In practice, this means the Network Token continuously accumulates micro-stakes across the entire ecosystem of personal tokens.

### Supply, allocation, and decentralization

To preserve fairness and stability, the Network Token is minted just once, with a capped total supply of 100 million tokens. At launch, only a limited portion (20%) is immediately available. This initial distribution covers early contributors, the founding team, early investors, liquidity providers, and community incentives.

- **20% Team & Early Contributors**: Tokens allocated to the founding team and early supporters vest gradually over four years, with a standard one-year cliff—aligning incentives with long-term project health.
- **50% Protocol Treasury**: Reserved for ecosystem development, grants, liquidity incentives, and future community-driven initiatives. These tokens unlock incrementally over several years, guided by community governance.
- **15% Early Investors**: Allocated to seed and early investors in the form of token warrants, vesting alongside the team to prevent rapid sell-offs.
- **10% Public Sales and Future Community Distribution**: Held back for future regulated token sales (Reg CF, Reg D) to invite broader community participation, progressively decentralizing ownership.
- **5% Liquidity and Market-making**: Provided upfront to ensure healthy trading liquidity and market stability.

### Dividends

Unlike personal tokens, the Network Token does not provide dividends to its holders as all proceeds will be used to fund the Network's operations and growth. As the Network grows and reaches sufficient scale and maturity, a growing percentage of the Network's capital gains will be distributed to Network Token holders.
