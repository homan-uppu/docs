title: The Net
---

The Net is the protocol itself — a set of open, on-chain contracts that mint personal tokens, record every fundraising or secondary sale, and route the 0.10 % “equity fee” (plus any secondary-sale royalties) into a single treasury.

Nobody owns the Net outright. It's a public-good financial rail to facilitate creating personal tokens and transacting personal token equities.
