## What are Secondary Sales?

Secondary sales allow existing shareholders to sell their equity in personal tokens to other investors. This creates a liquid market for personal token shares and provides exit opportunities for early investors.

## The Secondary Sale Process

### Initiating a Sale

When a shareholder wants to sell their equity, they create a **Secondary Sale Request** that includes:

- **Number of shares** they wish to sell
- **Asking price** per share
- **Offer validity period** (how long the offer remains active)
- **Any specific terms** or conditions

<Info>
  Secondary sales provide liquidity for investors while maintaining the token
  owner's control over their cap table composition.
</Info>

## Right of First Refusal (ROFR)

Similar to private companies, personal tokens implement a **Right of First Refusal** system to protect token owners and existing shareholders.

### ROFR Timeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sale Request Created">
    Shareholder initiates a Secondary Sale Request
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Owner Priority (14 days)">
    Token owner has first opportunity to purchase shares Can accept, decline, or
    negotiate terms
  </Step>
  <Step title="Existing Shareholders (7 days)">
    If token owner declines, existing shareholders get second priority Multiple
    shareholders can participate proportionally
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Market (If Not Purchased)">
    If no existing parties purchase, shares can be offered to new investors All
    transfers still require token owner approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Benefits of ROFR

**For Token Owners**:

- Maintain influence over cap table composition
- Prevent unwanted parties from acquiring shares
- Opportunity to consolidate ownership
- Control over shareholder relationships

**For Existing Shareholders**:

- Maintain their ownership percentage
- Prevent dilution from new investors
- Access to additional shares at market prices
- Alignment with other shareholders

## Royalty Structure

Each completed secondary sale generates a **2% royalty fee** automatically collected from the transaction value.

### Fee Distribution

- **1.5%** goes to the **token owner**
- **0.5%** goes to the **Network**

### Example Calculation

If an investor sells 50,000 shares at $5 per share:

- **Transaction value**: $250,000
- **Total fee**: $5,000 (2%)
- **Token owner receives**: $3,750 (1.5%)
- **Network receives**: $1,250 (0.5%)
- **Seller receives**: $245,000

<Tip>
  This royalty structure incentivizes token owners to approve secondary sales,
  creating ongoing revenue while providing liquidity for investors.
</Tip>

## Secondary Market Mechanics

### Pricing Discovery

Secondary market prices are determined by:

- **Recent performance** of the token owner
- **Dividend history** and expected future returns
- **Market sentiment** and demand
- **Portfolio composition** and asset performance
- **Overall Network conditions**

### Transaction Types

**Partial Sales**:

- Sell portion of holdings while maintaining position
- Common for profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing
- Allows continued participation in token growth

**Complete Exit**:

- Sell entire position in a personal token
- Full liquidity event for the investor
- May trigger tax implications

**Strategic Purchases**:

- Existing shareholders increasing their position
- New investors entering at market prices
- Token owners consolidating control
