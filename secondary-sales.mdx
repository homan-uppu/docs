When a shareholder wants to sell their equity in a personal token, they initiate a "Secondary Sale Request" in the Network. This request specifies the number of shares they wish to sell, their asking price, and how long the offer remains valid. Similar to private companies' [Right of First Refusal](https://www.angellist.com/learn/right-of-first-refusal) (ROFR), the token holder gets the first opportunity to purchase these shares. This ensures token holders maintain influence over their cap table and prevents unwanted parties from acquiring shares. If the token holder declines to purchase the shares, other existing shareholders receive second priority to maintain alignment among current investors.

The ROFR period lasts 14 days for the token holder and an additional 7 days for existing shareholders. If no existing shareholders purchase the shares during this period, the seller can either list their shares on the Network's internal marketplace or have someone they know apply to invest. All transfers must be approved by the token holder, and shares can only be transferred to other verified users in the Network.

For each completed secondary sale, a small royalty fee (2%) is automatically collected from the transaction value. This fee is split between the token owner (1.5%) and the Network (0.5%). This royalty structure creates an incentive for token owners to approve secondary sales, providing liquidity for early investors while generating ongoing returns for token owners as their personal token gains popularity in the secondary market.

For example: an investor purchased 100,000 shares of your personal token at 2 USD per share (200,000 USD total) during your fundraising round three years ago. Now, they wish to sell 50,000 shares at 5 USD per share (250,000 USD total) through a Secondary Sale Request. If you exercise your right of first refusal, you would pay 250,000 USD to reacquire these shares. If you decline, your existing shareholders have 7 days to purchase these shares. Assuming the sale completes at the 5 USD price, a 2% fee (5,000 USD) would be charged, with 3,750 USD (1.5%) going to you as the token owner and 1,250 USD (0.5%) going to the Network. The seller would receive 245,000 USD, and the buyer would receive 50,000 shares.
