## What is Dilution?

Dilution occurs when the percentage ownership of existing shareholders, including the token owner, decreases as new shares are issued during a fundraising round. While the absolute number of shares owned remains the same, each share represents a smaller percentage of the total token.

## How Dilution Works

With each funding round, ownership percentages shift as new shares are issued and the total number of outstanding shares increases.

### Basic Example

Let's say your personal token has these characteristics:

- **Total shares**: 10 million
- **Your ownership**: 9 million shares (90%)
- **Investor ownership**: 1 million shares (10%)

If you decide to raise more capital by selling an additional 1 million new shares:

- **New total shares**: 11 million
- **Your ownership**: 9 million ÷ 11 million = **81.8%** (down from 90%)
- **Original investor ownership**: 1 million ÷ 11 million = **9.1%** (down from 10%)
- **New investor ownership**: 1 million ÷ 11 million = **9.1%**

<Info>
  Notice how both you and your original investors experienced dilution, even
  though you received the full benefit of the new capital raised.

## Detailed Dilution Scenario

Here's a more comprehensive example showing multiple rounds:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial State">
    **Total shares**: 10M **Your ownership**: 10M shares (100%)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Series A">
    **New shares issued**: 1M at $1/share **Capital raised**: $1M **Total
    shares**: 11M **Your ownership**: 10M ÷ 11M = 90.9% **Investor ownership**:
    1M ÷ 11M = 9.1%
  </Step>
  <Step title="Series B">
    **New shares issued**: 2M at $2/share **Capital raised**: $4M **Total
    shares**: 13M **Your ownership**: 10M ÷ 13M = 76.9% **Series A investors**:
    1M ÷ 13M = 7.7% **Series B investors**: 2M ÷ 13M = 15.4%
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Result">
    **Total capital raised**: $5M **Your dilution**: From 100% to 76.9% **But
    you maintain control** and have significant capital
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Investor Protections Against Dilution

To protect early investors who take the highest risk, the Network provides several anti-dilution mechanisms:

### 1. Pro Rata Rights

Existing shareholders have the **right (but not obligation)** to participate in future funding rounds to maintain their ownership percentage.

**Example**: If an investor owns 5% and you're raising a new round, they can invest enough to maintain their 5% ownership after the round closes.

### 2. Information Rights

- **7-day minimum notice** before any fundraising round
- Shareholders receive details about:
  - Number of shares being sold
  - Price per share
  - Round timeline
  - How to exercise pro rata rights

### 3. Anti-Dilution Provisions

Protection against "down rounds" where you raise capital at a lower valuation than previous rounds.

**How it works**:

- If you previously sold shares at $2 each
- But now need to sell at $1 each (down round)
- The Network automatically adjusts early investors' share allocations
- Similar to weighted-average anti-dilution in traditional VC

<Warning>
  Anti-dilution provisions are automatically enforced by the Network's smart
  contracts. You cannot opt out of these protections.
</Warning>

## Strategic Considerations

### For Token Owners

**Benefits of accepting dilution**:

- Access to capital for growth and investments
- Bringing on strategic investors with valuable networks
- Sharing risk with aligned partners
- Potential for higher absolute returns even with lower percentage

**Managing dilution**:

- Price rounds appropriately to minimize unnecessary dilution
- Choose investors who add strategic value beyond capital
- Consider the long-term impact of each round
- Maintain control through board composition and voting rights

### For Investors

**Understanding your protection**:

- Pro rata rights help you avoid dilution in future rounds
- Information rights ensure you're informed about opportunities
- Anti-dilution provisions protect against down rounds
- Secondary market provides liquidity options

## Dilution vs. Value Creation

It's important to understand that dilution isn't inherently bad if it leads to value creation:

### Positive Scenario

- You raise $1M by selling 10% of your token
- Use that capital to make investments that generate 50% returns
- Your 90% ownership of a more valuable token may be worth more than your previous 100%

### Example Calculation

- **Before**: 100% of $5M token = $5M value
- **After**: 90% of $8M token = $7.2M value
- **Result**: Despite dilution, your value increased by $2.2M

<Tip>
  Focus on value creation, not just ownership percentage. Strategic dilution can
  be highly beneficial if it accelerates your growth and investment
  opportunities.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Planning Your Rounds

1. **Model different scenarios** before setting terms
2. **Consider long-term dilution** across multiple rounds
3. **Price rounds fairly** but don't undervalue yourself
4. **Communicate clearly** with existing investors

### Managing Investor Expectations

1. **Be transparent** about future fundraising plans
2. **Explain your growth strategy** and capital needs
3. **Give adequate notice** for pro rata participation
4. **Maintain regular communication** about progress
