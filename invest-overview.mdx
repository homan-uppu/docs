You can invest in personal tokens _through_ your personal token.

In order to accept an invitation from a user to invest, you must have sufficient capital in your personal token wallet to cover the investment amount.

There are 2 ways to profit from investing:

1. [Dividends](/docs/dividends)
2. Selling shares to another investor (or back to the token owner) at a higher price than you bought them for ([secondary sales](/docs/secondary-sales)).
