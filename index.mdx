## Welcome to Personal Tokens

Personal tokens represent your equities in companies and other personal tokens, creating a new way to invest in individuals and their potential across their entire career journey.

## How it Works

1. **Create your personal token** - Start with 10 million shares that you own entirely
2. **Raise capital** - Sell shares to investors through fundraising rounds
3. **Invest in others** - Use your capital to invest in other personal tokens
4. **Generate returns** - Earn through dividends and capital appreciation
5. **Build your network** - Create lasting relationships with investors and partners

<Note>
  You can only have one personal token on the network. Choose wisely as you
  can't delete an existing token to create a new one.
