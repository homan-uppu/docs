title: Network Token
---

the Network token represents all of the personal tokens in the Network.

The Network token has a total supply of 100 million shares, with only 20% (20 million shares) available for trading at launch. This controlled release helps maintain stability in the early phases of the Network. The available supply will increase gradually over time as the Network grows, with additional portions being released at key milestones in the Network's development.

Similar to personal tokens, the Network token accrues dividends. The wallet associated with the Network token serves as the Network's treasury. When new revenue enters the treasury, 30% is immediately distributed to Network Token shareholders, while 70% is retained to fund operations, legal compliance, development, security, and maintenance of the Network. Over time, as the Network matures, the distribution percentage will gradually increase to favor shareholders.
