title: Create your personal token

During the onboarding you'll receive a link to verify your identity by submitting a government issued ID and a selfie photo.

Once your identity is verified, you'll be issued a personal token and will be able to start transacting on the Net.

<Note>You can only have one personal token on the Net.</Note>
