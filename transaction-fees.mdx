## Overview

The Network operates on a transparent fee structure designed to sustain operations, incentivize participation, and create value for all users. There are three main types of fees that apply to different activities.

## Types of Transaction Fees

### 1. Gas Fees

**Purpose**: Facilitate transactions on the Network
**Amount**: Usually a few dollars per transaction
**Applied to**: All Network operations

Gas fees cover the computational costs of processing transactions on the Network, including:

- Creating personal tokens
- Processing fundraising rounds
- Executing investments
- Distributing dividends
- Recording ownership changes

<Info>
  Gas fees are minimal and designed to cover basic operational costs rather than
  generate revenue.
</Info>

### 2. Secondary Sales Fee

**Purpose**: Provide ongoing revenue for token owners and the Network
**Amount**: 2% of transaction value
**Applied to**: All secondary market transactions

The 2% fee is automatically split as follows:

- **1.5%** goes to the token owner
- **0.5%** goes to the Network

#### Example Calculation

If an investor sells shares worth $100,000:

- **Total fee**: $2,000 (2%)
- **Token owner receives**: $1,500 (1.5%)
- **Network receives**: $500 (0.5%)
- **Seller receives**: $98,000

<Tip>
  This fee structure incentivizes token owners to approve secondary sales,
  creating liquidity for investors while generating ongoing revenue.
</Tip>

### 3. Equity Fee

**Purpose**: Give the Network ownership in all personal tokens
**Amount**: 0.1% equity stake
**Applied to**: Each fundraising round
**Recipient**: Network Token

For every fundraising round, a small equity stake is automatically granted to the Network Token, creating an index-like ownership across all personal tokens.

#### How It Works

- You complete a fundraising round selling 1 million shares
- The Network automatically receives an additional 1,000 shares (0.1%)
- Total new shares: 1,001,000
- Network's ownership percentage grows with each round

## Fee Structure Benefits

## Network Token Economics

The Network Token accumulates value through multiple mechanisms:

### Equity Accumulation

- **0.1% equity** from every fundraising round
- **Compound growth** as successful tokens raise multiple rounds
- **Diversified portfolio** across all Network participants

### Fee Revenue

- **0.5% of secondary sales** provides ongoing revenue
- **Distributed to shareholders** as dividends (30%)
- **Reinvested in Network** for growth (70%)

### Example Network Token Growth

Consider the Network's position after significant activity:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Activity">
    100 personal tokens each complete 1 fundraising round Network receives 0.1%
    equity in each token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secondary Sales">
    $10M in secondary sales generates $50k in fees $15k distributed to Network
    Token shareholders $35k reinvested in Network operations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow-on Rounds">
    50 tokens complete second rounds at higher valuations Network's equity
    stakes become more valuable
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compounding Returns">
    Network Token represents diversified ownership Benefits from success across
    entire ecosystem
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Fee Transparency

### Real-time Tracking

The Network provides complete transparency about fees:

- **Fee calculations** shown before transaction confirmation
- **Historical fee data** available for all users
- **Network revenue reports** published regularly
- **Fee distribution tracking** for Network Token holders

### No Hidden Costs

All fees are:

- **Clearly disclosed** before transactions
- **Automatically calculated** with no surprises
- **Standardized** across all users
- **Auditable** through Network records

<Warning>
  There are no hidden fees or additional charges beyond the three fee types
  described above.
</Warning>

## Fee Optimization Strategies

### For Frequent Traders

- **Batch transactions** when possible to minimize gas fees
- **Time secondary sales** to maximize net proceeds
- **Consider fee impact** when setting sale prices
- **Monitor Network Token** for potential investment

### For Token Owners

- **Encourage secondary trading** to generate royalty revenue
- **Maintain token value** to increase royalty amounts
- **Build active shareholder base** to increase trading volume
- **Communicate value** to support higher sale prices

### For Long-term Investors

- **Factor fees into** investment return calculations
- **Hold for longer periods** to amortize transaction costs
- **Consider Network Token** as a way to benefit from ecosystem growth
- **Participate in pro rata** to minimize dilution from equity fees

## Future Fee Considerations

### Potential Adjustments

As the Network matures, fee structures may evolve:

- **Volume discounts** for high-activity users
- **Dynamic pricing** based on Network conditions
- **Additional fee types** for new features
- **Fee reductions** as scale increases efficiency

### Governance Participation

Network Token holders may have input on:

- **Fee structure changes**
- **Revenue distribution ratios**
- **New fee implementations**
- **Network development priorities**

<Note>
  Any significant fee changes would be announced well in advance and may require
  Network Token holder approval.
</Note>

## Comparing to Traditional Markets

### Traditional VC/Private Equity

- **Management fees**: 2-2.5% annually
- **Carry fees**: 20% of profits
- **Administrative costs**: Various additional fees
- **Limited liquidity**: Difficult to exit investments

### Personal Token Network

- **Gas fees**: Minimal transaction costs
- **Secondary sales**: 2% on sales only (not holdings)
- **Equity fees**: 0.1% dilution per fundraising round
- **Enhanced liquidity**: Active secondary market

<Info>
  The Network's fee structure is designed to be more transparent and
  investor-friendly than traditional private market alternatives.
