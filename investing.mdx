## Overview

You can invest in personal tokens **through** your personal token. This creates an interconnected network where everyone can invest in each other's success, building diversified portfolios of human capital and potential.

## Investment Requirements

### Capital Requirements

To invest in another personal token, you must have:

- **Sufficient USDC** in your personal token wallet
- **Enough capital** to cover the full investment amount
- **Active personal token** (you must have created your own token first)

### Investment Process

All investments are made **through your personal token**, not as an individual. This means:

- Your personal token becomes a shareholder in the target token
- Any returns benefit your personal token (and thus your shareholders)
- Investment decisions become part of your token's track record

<Info>
  Investing through your personal token aligns your interests with your
  shareholders, as they benefit from your investment success.

## How to Profit from Investing

There are **two main ways** to generate returns from personal token investments:

### 1. Dividends

Receive proportional capital gains when the token owner sells equity in assets.

**Example**:

- You own 5% of Jane's personal token
- Jane sells company shares for $100,000 profit
- You receive $5,000 (5% of the capital gain)
- This dividend is distributed to your shareholders proportionally

### 2. Capital Appreciation

Sell your shares to another investor at a higher price than you paid.

**Example**:

- You bought 10,000 shares at $2 each ($20,000 total)
- Token owner's success increases demand for their shares
- You sell 5,000 shares at $4 each ($20,000 total)
- Your profit: $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000 capital gain

## Investment Strategy

### Early vs. Proven Investments

**Early-stage investments**:

- Higher risk, higher potential return
- Bet on potential and future success
- Lower entry prices
- Greater upside if the person succeeds

**Proven investments**:

- Lower risk, steady returns
- Established track record
- Higher entry prices
- More predictable dividend flow

### Diversification Strategies

**Portfolio approach**:

- Invest in multiple personal tokens
- Different industries and backgrounds
- Various stages of career development
- Mix of high-risk and stable investments

**Sector focus**:

- Concentrate on specific industries
- Leverage your expertise and network
- Develop deep understanding of the space
- Benefit from sector trends

### Due Diligence

Before investing, consider:

- **Track record** - Past performance and achievements
- **Network** - Professional relationships and influence
- **Portfolio** - Current assets and investments
