## What is the Network?

The Network is the ecosystem where all personal tokens exist and interact. It's a interconnected system that enables individuals to raise capital, invest in each other, and build lasting financial relationships.

## The Network Token

The Network Token is a special token that represents ownership in an index of all personal tokens in the ecosystem. Unlike personal tokens, it's not tied to any individual user but rather to the Network itself.

### Key Characteristics

- **Total supply**: 100 million shares
- **Available at launch**: 20 million shares (20%)
- **Controlled release**: Additional shares released at key Network milestones
- **Purpose**: Represents collective ownership in all personal tokens

### How It Works

The Network Token automatically acquires equity in personal tokens through:

1. **Equity fees**: 0.1% equity stake for each fundraising round
2. **Secondary sales fees**: 0.5% of transaction value
3. **Network growth**: More fundraising = greater Network Token equity

<Info>
  The Network Token essentially becomes a diversified index fund of all personal
  tokens, growing stronger as the Network expands.
</Info>

## Revenue Distribution

When the Network Token generates revenue, it's distributed as follows:

- **30%** - Immediately distributed to Network Token shareholders as dividends
- **70%** - Retained in treasury for:
  - Operations and maintenance
  - Legal compliance
  - Development and security
  - Network infrastructure

<Note>
  As the Network matures, the distribution percentage will gradually increase to
  favor shareholders more heavily.
