You can raise capital by selling shares of your personal token through discrete fundraising "rounds."

When you initiate a round, you specify the terms of your offering: how many shares you want to sell and at what price per share. This establishes your token's valuation and determines how much ownership percentage you're transferring to investors.

You can share a link to your active round with prospective investors, who can then indicate their interest and proposed investment amount. You maintain complete control over investor selection, allowing you to curate your cap table strategically. Each investor you accept will receive shares proportional to their investment, becoming shareholders.

When you complete the round, the investment funds are immediately deposited into your personal token wallet, and the Network automatically updates all ownership records to reflect the new distribution of shares.
