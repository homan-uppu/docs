title: The Company (CCorp)

The C-Corp is the Delaware company that: owns the flagship web/mobile front-end and trademarks, will carry the U.S. broker-dealer / ATS licences that make personal-token trading legal for retail users, employs the engineers and absorbs early compliance costs.

In other words, the C-Corp is the first (eventually not the only) operator that connects people to the Net.
