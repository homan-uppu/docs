## What are Dividends?

If you have shareholders in your personal token, whenever you sell equity in a personal token or company at a profit, the capital gains (the profit portion, not the entire proceeds) are distributed to your shareholders proportional to their ownership in your personal token.

## How Dividend Distribution Works

### Capital Gains Only

Dividends are based on **capital gains** (profit), not the entire sale proceeds.

**Example**:

- You purchased personal token shares for **$10,000**
- You later sold them for **$15,000**
- **Capital gain**: $15,000 - $10,000 = **$5,000**
- **Dividend pool**: $5,000 (only the profit portion)

### Proportional Distribution

Capital gains are distributed to shareholders based on their exact ownership percentage in your personal token.

**Example scenario**:

- **Your ownership**: 80%
- **Investor A**: 15%
- **Investor B**: 5%
- **Capital gain**: $10,000

**Distribution**:

- **You receive**: $10,000 × 80% = $8,000
- **Investor A receives**: $10,000 × 15% = $1,500
- **Investor B receives**: $10,000 × 5% = $500

<Info>
  Dividend distribution happens automatically through the Network's smart
  contracts, ensuring accurate and immediate payments.
</Info>

## Types of Equity Sales

### Personal Token Sales (Immediate)

When you sell equity in another personal token:

- Capital gains are **immediately calculated** and distributed
- Payments happen **instantly** through the Network
- No manual reporting required
- All information is automatically tracked

### Company Equity Sales (Manual Reporting)

When you sell equity in a company:

- You must **manually report** the transaction
- **Annual reporting deadline** (by tax deadline)
- You deposit the dividend amount into the Network
- Distribution then happens automatically

<Warning>
  Failure to report company equity sales on time may affect your reputation
  score in the Network, which is visible to current and potential investors.
</Warning>

## Dividend Flow Mechanics

### Single-Level Distribution

Capital gains distributions flow directly to your token holders but **do not cascade** further up the network.

**Example**:

- Alice holds shares of Bob's personal token
- Bob holds shares of Dan's personal token
- When Dan sells equity and generates capital gains:
  - Gains are distributed to Dan's token holders (including Bob)
  - Gains **stop there** - they don't flow to Bob's token holders (like Alice)
  - Alice can only benefit if Bob's token value increases and she sells at a higher price

### Immediate vs. Deferred Benefits

- **Direct shareholders**: Receive immediate dividend payments
- **Indirect shareholders**: Benefit only through increased token value
