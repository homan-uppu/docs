## Complete

Mark your fundraising round as **Complete** when you have finished accepting investments and are ready to finalize the round. Completing a round will:

1. Lock in the final list of investors and their share allocations.
2. Trigger the transfer of funds from escrow to your wallet (after the "completion delay" period — see "Undo" below).
3. Update the ownership records for your personal token.

---

## Cancel

You can cancel an active round at any time before it is completed.

Canceling a round will:

1. Return all escrowed funds to the investors who participated.
2. Void any pending or accepted investment offers for this round.
3. Leave your cap table unchanged.

Canceling is irreversible—if you want to raise again, you'll need to start a new round.

## Undo

By default, you can undo a round for up to 6 hours after it has been completed. You can edit this "completion delay" value in your settings.
