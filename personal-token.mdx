Your personal token is an instrument that represents your equities in companies and other personal tokens.

Personal tokens exist within a network (the "Net"). Every user, whether they want to raise capital, or invest in other personal tokens, will need to create their personal token.

When you first create your personal token, it's divided into 10 million shares - which you own all of. When you raise capital, you issue new shares to investors who become your personal token "shareholders".

Your personal token contains information about who you are, your token shareholders, and history of transactions: fundraising events, assets (equities in companies and other personal tokens) and investment history.

You can only have one personal token on the network. You can't delete an existing personal token to create a new one.

A personal token is associated with a wallet that holds [USDC](https://www.notion.so/docs-1f97eb80e06c800a84e8e4bf40fc04c9?pvs=21). This wallet is where funds are deposited when you successfully raise capital by selling shares of your personal token, and where funds are withdrawn from to facilitate investments you make in other personal tokens.
