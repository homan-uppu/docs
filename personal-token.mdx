Your personal token represents your equities in companies and other personal tokens. It's a digital representation of your investment portfolio and potential, allowing others to invest in your success across your entire career.

## How Personal Tokens Work

Personal tokens exist within the Network. Every user, whether they want to raise capital or invest in other personal tokens, must create their personal token first.

### Initial Structure

When you first create your personal token, it starts with:

- **10 million total shares**
- **You own 100% of all shares**
- **A connected wallet that holds USDC**

### Token Information

Your personal token contains comprehensive information about:

- **Your identity and profile**
- **Your token shareholders** and their ownership percentages
- **Transaction history** including fundraising events
- **Your assets** (equities in companies and other personal tokens)
- **Investment history** and performance

### The Connected Wallet

Each personal token is associated with a USDC wallet that serves as:

- **Deposit location** for funds from successful fundraising rounds
- **Withdrawal source** for investments you make in other personal tokens
- **Treasury** for managing your token's financial operations

<Warning>
  You can only have **one personal token** on the network. You cannot delete an
  existing personal token to create a new one, so choose your approach
  carefully.
</Warning>
