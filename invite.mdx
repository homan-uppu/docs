## Visibility states

Your active round can be in one of the following states:

1. **Private Invite Only**. Explicitly select users in the Net to send an invitation to participate in your round. Those outside of the people you invite won't be able to view your active round.
2. **Private With Link**. Anyone with a link to your fundraising round can view it and request to participate.
3. **Open to Net**. Any user on the Net can view your fundraising round and request to participate.

## Transaction

When an investor accepts your invitation to invest, they submit how much they want to invest. Once you view their proposal, you have the option to "accept". At this point, the capital from the investor's wallet is transferred to an escrow on chain that holds it until 6hrs after the round is completed (you can change this "delay" duration in your settings), at which point it is transferred to your wallet. In the case the round is canceled, the capital is returned to the investor's wallet.
