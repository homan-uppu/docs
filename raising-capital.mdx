description: "How to raise capital by selling shares of your personal token through fundraising rounds"
---

## Overview

You can raise capital by selling shares of your personal token through discrete fundraising "rounds." This process allows you to set your own terms, choose your investors, and receive immediate funding while maintaining control over your cap table.

## How Fundraising Works

### Setting Up a Round

When you initiate a fundraising round, you specify:

- **Number of shares to sell** - How much of your token you're offering
- **Price per share** - Your valuation of each share
- **Round duration** - How long the round will remain open
- **Investment minimums/maximums** - Size constraints for individual investments

### Valuation Example

Selling 1 million shares (10% of your token) at $1 per share values your entire token at $10 million:

- **Shares for sale**: 1,000,000 (10% of total)
- **Price per share**: $1.00
- **Total raise**: $1,000,000
- **Implied valuation**: $10,000,000

<Info>
  Your token's valuation is determined by the price per share you set multiplied
  by the total number of shares (10 million).

## The Investment Process

### 1. Share Your Round

- Generate a unique link for your active round
- Share with prospective investors
- Control who can view and access your round

### 2. Receive Interest

- Investors indicate their interest through the platform
- They specify their proposed investment amount
- You can see all expressions of interest in one place

### 3. Curate Your Investors

- **You maintain complete control** over investor selection
- Review each investor's profile and proposed investment
- Accept or decline each investor individually
- Build your cap table strategically

### 4. Complete the Round

- Once you've accepted sufficient investments, close the round
- **Funds are immediately deposited** into your personal token wallet
- **Ownership records are automatically updated** across the Network
- New shareholders receive their shares proportional to their investment

## Investor Protections

To create alignment with early investors who take the highest risk, personal tokens include several protections:

### Pro Rata Rights

- **Existing shareholders** have the right (but not obligation) to participate in future rounds
- Allows early investors to maintain their ownership percentage
- Provides opportunity for continued support without dilution

### Information Rights

- **Shareholders must receive notice** of upcoming fundraising rounds
- **Minimum 7 days advance notice** required
- Gives existing investors time to exercise their pro rata rights

### Anti-Dilution Provisions

- Protection against "down rounds" (fundraising at lower valuations)
- **Automatic adjustment** of share allocations for early investors
- Similar to weighted-average anti-dilution provisions in traditional VC

<Warning>
  These protections are automatically enforced by the Network to ensure fair
  treatment of all investors.
</Warning>

## Example Fundraising Scenario

Let's walk through a typical fundraising round:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Setup">
    You start with 10 million shares, owning 100%
  </Step>
  <Step title="First Round">
    You sell 500,000 shares at $2 each, raising $1M Your ownership: 9.5M/10M =
    95% Investor ownership: 500K/10M = 5%
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Round">
    You sell 1M more shares at $3 each, raising $3M Total shares now: 11M Your
    ownership: 9.5M/11M = 86.4% Previous investors: 500K/11M = 4.5% New
    investors: 1M/11M = 9.1%
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completion">
    You've raised $4M total while maintaining majority control
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

## After Your Round

Once you complete a fundraising round:

4. **Keep shareholders informed** about your progress and performance
