Move USDC from your personal-token wallet to any external address or straight back to your bank.

### 1. Open the “Withdraw USDC” panel

Enter the amount you'd like to move. The interface shows an estimated gas fee and your post-withdrawal balance in real time.

### 2. Pick a destination

1. Crypto wallet: Paste any ERC-20 address you control (MetaMask, Ledger, Coinbase Wallet, etc.).
2. Fiat off-ramp: Select “Bank transfer” to use our Stripe / FortressPay off-ramp. You’ll enter your routing and account numbers once; future withdrawals clear automatically.

### 3. Confirm the transaction

1. For blockchain withdrawals we broadcast the transfer instantly; you'll see funds after the usual confirmation window.
2. For bank withdrawals PTN first sends USDC to the off-ramp partner, which converts to USD and pushes an ACH credit to your bank (1-2 business days).

### 4. Track status

Every withdrawal gets a unique ID and a status badge—Pending, In Flight, Completed. You can download a CSV for tax records any time.

**Withdraw limits**: During early access you can withdraw up to \$250 000 per rolling 24-hour period. Larger amounts require a quick email to compliance for manual approval.
