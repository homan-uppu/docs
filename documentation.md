# PersonalTokenNet

## Getting Started

### How It Works

This is a brief overview of the main concepts of PersonalTokenNet.
## A personal token
At the heart of the system is a personal token: an instrument that is tied to a single human being, that represents their potential to create economic value — grounded in their equities in companies and other personal tokens (NO personal assets such as houses, cars, salaries, etc. are a part of the personal token).
Anyone looking to transact in any way with personal tokens will need to create their own personal token.
## The "Net"
The "Net" is the network of personal tokens. Like how people have personal tokens, the Net has a "NetworkToken" which can gain equity in other personal tokens (see "equity fee" below).
You can also buy equity in the NetworkToken which is a way to indirectly invest in the success of the entire Net. (Note: this is not possible during early access.).
## Fundraising (selling equity in your personal token)
A personal token is divided into shares: its smallest unity of equity. When you fundraise by selling equity in your personal token, you are selling shares of your personal token to investors who will then become shareholders of your personal token, and join you in your journey without having any control (voting rights, etc.) over you in any way.
[Learn more about fundraising](/fundraise-overview).
## Obligations after you fundraise.
When you fundraise, you are promising to pay dividends to your shareholders. Each shareholder gets a percentage of your capital gains (from selling equity in companies or other personal tokens) proportional to how much equity they have in your personanl token (before federal / state capital gains taxes are applied). _(For example: if you sell your equity in a company for \$3 million, and you have 3 shareholders who each own 1% of your personal token, each shareholder will get \$30,000 in capital gains, before any taxes are applied)._
If you have personal token shareholders you will need to report your capital gains every year to PersonalTokenNet and make sure your personanl token wallet has enough money to pay dividends to your shareholders (which will be transfered from your personal token wallet to the shareholder's personal token wallet within the Net). You only have to do this once a year (by the US tax deadline), and we'll remind you and walk you through the process when the time comes.
You can also keep your shareholders up-to-date on your progress if you feel like it, but it's not required. Your shareholders are incentivized to help you win since they have skin in your game. The more transparent you are with them, and the more clearly you communicate what you want, the easier it will be for them to help you. Use them!
Learn more about [dividends](/dividends) & [reporting capital gains](/reporting-capital-gains).
## Investing (in personal tokens)
You need enough money in your personal token wallet to cover the amount you want to invest before your purchase goes through.
If a personal token fundraising round is public to the Net, you can request the token owner to allow you to invest in their personal token. Otherwise, you can only invest in personal tokens that you have been invited to invest in.
There are 2 ways to profit from investing:
1. Earn [dividends](/docs/dividends)
2. Selling equity to another investor ([secondary sales](/docs/secondary-sales)).
[Learn more about investing](/invest-overview).
## Fees
On successful fundraise:
- Gas fee: a nominal amount (usually a few dollars) to facilitate a transaction in the Network.
- Admin fee: occurs when a shareholder raises capital through a fundraising round.
- Equity fee: a small (0.1% equity) is allocated to the [Network Token](/network-token) (similar to a personal token but one that represents the entire Net).
(These fees will be negligibly small compared to the amount of money you're raising.)
For secondary sales:
- Gas fee.
- A royalty fee of (2%) is automatically collected from the transaction value. This fee is split between the token owner (1.5%) and the NetworkToken (0.5%)
[Learn more about fees](/fees).
## Early access restrictions
- California residents only (and ofc legally in the US).
- Access is invite-only.
## Legal stuff
When you fundraise, both you and investors will be asked to sign a [Token Purchase Agreement](/legal#token-purchase-agreement-overview) which outlines the terms of the investment.
If you're raising more than $250,000, a [single-member California LLC](/legal#llc-issuer-after-250k-in-total-primary-sales) will be formed on your behalf which will be the [legal issuer](/legal#issuer) of the personal token.
After you successfuly fundraise, [a Form D and a California Blue-Sky Notice](/legal#filings-for-successful-fundraising-rounds) are filed on your behalf.
## Taxes
Yeah, there's some tax paperwork that we'll make seamless for you (filing on your behalf wherever possible while keeping you in the loop).

### A personal token

Your personal token is an instrument that represents your equities in companies and other personal tokens.
![\2](\1)
Personal tokens exist within a network (the "Net"). Every user, whether they want to raise capital, or invest in other personal tokens, will need to create their personal token.
When you first create your personal token, it's divided into 10 million shares - which you own all of. When you raise capital, you issue new shares to investors who become your personal token "shareholders".
Your personal token contains information about who you are, your token shareholders, and history of transactions: fundraising events, assets (equities in companies and other personal tokens) and investment history.
You can only have one personal token on the network. You can't delete an existing personal token to create a new one.
A personal token is associated with a wallet that holds [USDC](https://www.notion.so/docs-1f97eb80e06c800a84e8e4bf40fc04c9?pvs=21). This wallet is where funds are deposited when you successfully raise capital by selling shares of your personal token, and where funds are withdrawn from to facilitate investments you make in other personal tokens.

---

### Create Personal Token

During the onboarding you'll receive a link to verify your identity by submitting a government issued ID and a selfie photo.
Once your identity is verified, you'll be issued a personal token and will be able to start transacting on the Net.
You can only have one personal token on the Net.

---

## Fundraise

### Overview

You can raise capital by selling shares of your personal token through discrete fundraising "rounds."
When you initiate a round, you specify the terms of your offering: how many shares you want to sell and at what price per share. This establishes your token's valuation and determines how much ownership percentage you're transferring to investors.
You can share a link to your active round with prospective investors, who can then indicate their interest and proposed investment amount. You maintain complete control over investor selection, allowing you to curate your cap table strategically. Each investor you accept will receive shares proportional to their investment, becoming shareholders.
When you complete the round, the investment funds are immediately deposited into your personal token wallet, and the Network automatically updates all ownership records to reflect the new distribution of shares.

---

### Dilution

With each funding round, ownership percentages shift as new shares are issued. Your original shareholders (including yourself) will experience some degree of ownership dilution as the total number of outstanding shares increases.
Dilution is when the percentage ownership of existing shareholders, including the token owner, decreases when the token owner issues new shares during a fundraising round.
For example: let's say your personal token has 10 million total shares, and you own 9 million (90%) after an initial fundraising round where investors purchased 1 million shares (10%). If you decide to raise more capital by selling an additional 1 million new shares, the total share count increases to 11 million. After this second round, you would own 9 million out of 11 million shares (approximately 81.8%), while your initial investors would own 1 million out of 11 million (approximately 9.1%).
To create alignment with early investors who take the highest risk, personal tokens incorporate certain protections borrowed from traditional equity structures:1
1. **Pro rata rights**: existing shareholders have the right (but not obligation) to participate in future funding rounds to maintain their ownership percentage. This gives early believers in your potential the opportunity to continue supporting your journey without being diluted.
2. **Information rights**: shareholders must receive notice of an upcoming fundraising round at least a week in advance so that they have time to exercise their pro rata rights.
3. **Anti-dilution provisions**: if you raise capital at a valuation lower than previous rounds (a "down round"), the Network will automatically adjust share allocations to protect early investors from severe dilution, similar to [weighted-average anti-dilution provisions](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fd0n/53%20Weighted%20Average%20Anti-dilution.htm) in traditional venture financing.

### Invite

## Invite investors
## Open up round to entire Net

### Withdraw Capital

Move USDC from your personal-token wallet to any external address or straight back to your bank.
### 1. Open the “Withdraw USDC” panel
Enter the amount you'd like to move. The interface shows an estimated gas fee and your post-withdrawal balance in real time.
### 2. Pick a destination
1. Crypto wallet: Paste any ERC-20 address you control (MetaMask, Ledger, Coinbase Wallet, etc.).
2. Fiat off-ramp: Select “Bank transfer” to use our Stripe / FortressPay off-ramp. You’ll enter your routing and account numbers once; future withdrawals clear automatically.
### 3. Confirm the transaction
1. For blockchain withdrawals we broadcast the transfer instantly; you'll see funds after the usual confirmation window.
2. For bank withdrawals PTN first sends USDC to the off-ramp partner, which converts to USD and pushes an ACH credit to your bank (1-2 business days).
### 4. Track status
Every withdrawal gets a unique ID and a status badge—Pending, In Flight, Completed. You can download a CSV for tax records any time.
---
**Withdraw limits**: During early access you can withdraw up to \$250 000 per rolling 24-hour period. Larger amounts require a quick email to compliance for manual approval.
**Gas optimisation**: We batch small requests. If you're withdrawing less than \$100 USDC, we'll wait up to 10 minutes to combine it with other outbound transfers so everyone saves on gas.

---

## Invest

### Overview

You can invest in personal tokens _through_ your personal token.
In order to accept an invitation from a user to invest, you must have sufficient capital in your personal token wallet to cover the investment amount.
There are 2 ways to profit from investing:
1. [Dividends](/docs/dividends)
2. Selling shares to another investor (or back to the token owner) at a higher price than you bought them for ([secondary sales](/docs/secondary-sales)).

---

### Deposit Capital (USDC)

Getting money into your PersonalTokenNet wallet is as simple as funding any other USDC-compatible address—think of it as topping up an exchange account.
### 1. Grab your wallet address
In your dashboard you'll see a “Deposit USDC” panel. Copy the address shown there; it is a standard ERC-20 address that lives on the same chain the Net runs on.
### 2. Choose an on-ramp
Already have USDC? Send it directly from any self-custody wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet) or exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini).
Need to buy USDC with dollars? Use an integrated fiat on-ramp (Ramp Network or Stripe on-ramp) or buy on a major exchange, then withdraw to the address from Step 1.
### 3. Make the transfer
Select the same network PTN uses (Ethereum Mainnet during early access).
Paste the address, pick an amount, and confirm.
The dashboard marks the deposit as “Pending” while we wait for 3 block confirmations, then credits your personal-token wallet automatically.
---
**Heads-up on fees**: You pay the normal gas fee to move USDC on-chain; PTN charges nothing to accept a deposit.
**Minimums**: For now we accept deposits as small as $25 to keep gas overhead reasonable.
Once your balance shows up you can invest in other personal tokens immediately.

---

### Secondary Sales

When a shareholder wants to sell their equity in a personal token, they initiate a "Secondary Sale Request" in the Network. This request specifies the number of shares they wish to sell, their asking price, and how long the offer remains valid. Similar to private companies' [Right of First Refusal](https://www.angellist.com/learn/right-of-first-refusal) (ROFR), the token holder gets the first opportunity to purchase these shares. This ensures token holders maintain influence over their cap table and prevents unwanted parties from acquiring shares. If the token holder declines to purchase the shares, other existing shareholders receive second priority to maintain alignment among current investors.
The ROFR period lasts 14 days for the token holder and an additional 7 days for existing shareholders. If no existing shareholders purchase the shares during this period, the seller can either list their shares on the Network's internal marketplace or have someone they know apply to invest. All transfers must be approved by the token holder, and shares can only be transferred to other verified users in the Network.
For each completed secondary sale, a small [royalty fee](/fees#secondary-sale-transaction-fee) is charged.

---

## Core concepts

### Secondary sale transaction fee

A royalty fee of (2%) is automatically collected from the transaction value. This fee is split between the token owner (1.5%) and the Network (0.5%). This royalty structure creates an incentive for token owners to approve secondary sales, providing liquidity for early investors while generating ongoing returns for token owners as their personal token gains popularity in the secondary market.
For example: an investor purchased 100,000 shares of your personal token at 2 USD per share (200,000 USD total) during your fundraising round three years ago. Now, they wish to sell 50,000 shares at 5 USD per share (250,000 USD total) through a Secondary Sale Request. If you exercise your right of first refusal, you would pay 250,000 USD to reacquire these shares. If you decline, your existing shareholders have 7 days to purchase these shares. Assuming the sale completes at the 5 USD price, a 2% fee (5,000 USD) would be charged, with 3,750 USD (1.5%) going to you as the token owner and 1,250 USD (0.5%) going to the Network. The seller would receive 245,000 USD, and the buyer would receive 50,000 shares.
### Equity fee
Every time an individual raises funds through their personal token on the Net, a modest fraction of newly issued shares—just 0.1%—is automatically allocated to the [Network Token](/network-token). In practice, this means the Network Token continuously accumulates micro-stakes across the entire ecosystem of personal tokens.

---

### Dividends

If you have shareholders in your personal token, whenever you sell equity in a personal token or a company at a profit, the capital gains (the profit portion, not the entire proceeds) from that sale are distributed to those who hold equity in your personal token - proportional to how much equity they hold.
For example, if you purchased personal token or company shares for 10,000 USD and later sold them for 15,000 USD, the 5,000 USD profit would be distributed to your personal token shareholders according to their ownership percentages.
Capital gains distributions flow directly to the holders of the seller's personal token, but do not cascade further up the network. For example, if Alice holds shares of Bob's personal token, and Bob holds shares of Dan's personal token, then when Dan sells equity and generates capital gains, these gains are distributed proportionally to Dan's token holders (including Bob) but stop there - they do not automatically flow up to Bob's token holders (like Alice). Alice can only benefit from Dan's success indirectly if Bob's token value increases due to his gains from Dan, and Alice then sells her equity in Bob's token at this higher value.
Dividends are immediately paid out when you sell equity in a personal token - since that capital and information lies within the network. On the other hand, when you sell equity in a company, it's your responsibility to pay dividends for that to your shareholders through the network. You can do this on a yearly basis, by the US tax deadline.
We're building tooling to make this a very simple process for you. Any discrepancies / delays may affect your reputation in the network, which will be visible to your shareholders, future shareholders, and those you want to invest in.

### Reporting Capital Gains

If you have shareholders, when you sell equity in companies, since they exist outside of the Network, it's your responsibility to report these transactions and distribute the appropriate capital gains to your shareholders. If you don't have shareholders there's no need to report.
You are required to report your equity sales once a year, before the tax deadline. You'll provide basic information about what you sold, when you sold it, your original purchase price, and the sale price.
Most users can complete this annual reporting in minutes through our simple interface. We're actively building integrations with popular equity management platforms and investment services, which will allow many of your transactions to be imported automatically when these integrations launch. For transactions not covered by these integrations, you'll upload standard documents you're already preparing for taxes, like transaction records or tax forms. Our system calculates the capital gains and processes the actual distribution to your shareholders. If your personal token wallet doesn't have sufficient capital, you will be prompted to deposit the necessary funds.
The Network maintains a reputation system that tracks your reporting history and accuracy. Consistent, timely reporting enhances your reputation score, which is visible to current and potential investors. Significant discrepancies or delays in reporting may affect this score. For larger transactions, a small percentage of distributed funds may be temporarily held in escrow until verification is complete.
We're going to make this process as simple and automated as possible. We'll be there by your side to minimize admin BS.

### Network Token

At its heart, the Network Token is an index that represents the potential of every citizen of the Net, by capturing a tiny fraction of every personal token that successfully raises capital. Owning shares in the Network Token is a bet on the collective potential of everyone in the Net.
### How does the Network Token capture value?
Every time an individual raises funds through their personal token on the Net, a modest fraction of newly issued shares—just 0.1%—is automatically allocated to the Network Token treasury. In practice, this means the Network Token continuously accumulates micro-stakes across the entire ecosystem of personal tokens.
### Supply, allocation, and decentralization
To preserve fairness and stability, the Network Token is minted just once, with a capped total supply of 100 million tokens. At launch, only a limited portion (20%) is immediately available. This initial distribution covers early contributors, the founding team, early investors, liquidity providers, and community incentives.
- **20% Team & Early Contributors**: Tokens allocated to the founding team and early supporters vest gradually over four years, with a standard one-year cliff—aligning incentives with long-term project health.
- **50% Protocol Treasury**: Reserved for ecosystem development, grants, liquidity incentives, and future community-driven initiatives. These tokens unlock incrementally over several years, guided by community governance.
- **15% Early Investors**: Allocated to seed and early investors in the form of token warrants, vesting alongside the team to prevent rapid sell-offs.
- **10% Public Sales and Future Community Distribution**: Held back for future regulated token sales (Reg CF, Reg D) to invite broader community participation, progressively decentralizing ownership.
- **5% Liquidity and Market-making**: Provided upfront to ensure healthy trading liquidity and market stability.
### Dividends
Unlike personal tokens, the Network Token does not provide dividends to its holders as all proceeds will be used to fund the Network's operations and growth. As the Network grows and reaches sufficient scale and maturity, a growing percentage of the Network's capital gains will be distributed to Network Token holders.

### Sufficient Decentralization

Given the long-term nature of the underlying asset (personal tokens), this system needs to be implemented in a way that stands the test of time. Investments made today must be preserved centuries into the future. This isn't just nice-to-have, it's critically important for the success of this idea because without a sufficient guarantee of longetivity, most people wouldn't even participate (would you buy a home if you didn't think it would be around in 10 years?).
We can only succeed with sufficient decentralization. The failure of this company or team shouldn't take the entire system with it.
The purpose of this page is to make clear our intention and high level ideas for how we will achieve sufficient decentralization (and progressively increase degree of decentralization). We'll publish a much more detailed plan when the time is right. (_[Reach out](https://x.com/homanspirit) if you want to help._)
## Organizational structure
We will bring this idea to the world through two distinct entities: a non-profit foundation and a for-profit [public-benefit-company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation).
### 1. The Foundation
(Delaware non-stock, public-benefit corporation (non-profit)).
The Foundation owns and governs the underlying technical protocol, the ledger (information about who contains how much of which personal tokens), and the [Network Token](/network-token) & the capital that the Network Token accrues in its wallet via the [equity fees](/fees#equity-fee). The Network Token's wallet is treated as the Foundation's treasury.
As the Net scales to the world, this Network Token will eventually represent all of humanity's potential. It's critically important we design the Foundation thoughtfully and progressively decentralize its own governance to make it resilient to individual insanity.
### 2. The Company
(Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)).
The Company will be the interface between the Net and the real world by complying with all laws and regulations, and ensuring off-Net activity (relevant to personal tokens) is reflected on-Net (e.g. [reporting capital gains](/reporting-capital-gains)).
In addition to this, the Company will create what's needed to create a thriving ecosystem of users investing in each other. This will likely include:
- Admission & identity. (ensuring each personal token owner meets requirements and verifies identity).
- Reputation. (penalizing)
- Applications (that connect users to the Net).
- Customer support
- Ban (and / or freeze) bad actors.
- Discovery.
Of course, not all of these functions will exist on day 1. The Company will operate like a hungry startup: building as little as required to get traction and grow.
## Transparency & competition
Yes, the Company has a lot of power at the start in order to bring this idea to the world as swiftly as possible. But, the underlying set up still has a key advantage: transparency. Any move the Company makes is recorded on-chain. For example, the Company can't just ban users without everyone knowing. And therefore won't be able to be too mis-aligned with how users want to use the Net.
And, in the case that users aren't happy with how the Company is operating (or even any function of the Company), they can always create their own companies / organizations to operate on top of the Net to compete with the Company (or some of its functions). For example, a competiting team can focus purely on building the best reputation system, or application (client) that connects to the Net, or a discovery engine to connect individuals and investors, etc.
By opening ourselves up to such competition at the foundational level will help hold us accountable to help manifest this idea in the way that the world wants. If we begin to deviate too much from what people want, or let things get to our heads, users will (and should) have the option to switch to different providers that operate on the same Net.
It will be the Foundation's responsibility to ensure an easy path for competitors to participate as operators on top of the Net, **even if that means competition for the Company**.

### Legal

## Issuer
### Individual issuer (up to $250k in total primary sales)
When you first issue a personal token and raise up to US $250 000 in total primary sales, you (the individual) are the legal “issuer.” Under U.S. securities law a natural person can issue an investment contract just as a company can, so no separate entity is required. Each fundraising round is filed under Rule 506 of Regulation D: we generate the Form D and the California §25102(f) notice, investors self-certify that they are accredited, and the Token Purchase Agreement contains a non-recourse clause that limits their recovery to the token and its on-chain assets. In plain English, your house, savings, or salary remain untouchable unless you commit fraud.
### LLC issuer (after $250k in total primary sales)
Once your cumulative raises cross US $250 000, PersonalTokenNet automatically forms a single-member California LLC to step in as the new issuer. Nothing about the token's supply or shareholder record changes; we simply novate the existing contracts so that (i) future legal claims run against the LLC, and (ii) you gain the full statutory liability shield that corporate law provides. Investors re-sign a short joinder acknowledging the LLC; all subsequent Form D filings list the LLC as issuer, and future rounds continue exactly as before. The non-recourse language stays in place, but is now backed by the LLC's limited-liability status for an extra layer of protection.
## Token Purchase Agreement (overview)
Think of the Token Purchase Agreement as the simple, grown-up handshake that makes a personal token more than a clever idea on the internet. On one side is you—the founder, designer, athlete or creator—who wants to raise money by selling a sliver of your future upside. On the other side is the investor, someone who meets the SEC's “accredited” standard and has decided your trajectory is worth backing. The Agreement spells out what that investor is actually buying: an on-chain token that entitles them to a fixed percentage of whatever cash you eventually pocket when you turn any of your equity into money—whether that equity is stock from a day-job, options in a start-up you advise, or even another personal token you hold.
Nothing about the deal forces you to hand physical share certificates to a third-party vault. You keep your Stripe options, neighbourhood-coffee-shop shares or personal-token positions exactly where they already sit. The only promise you make is that, once a year—and no later than the day you file your taxes—you will sweep the agreed slice of any realised gains into a wallet managed for your token holders. That wallet lives inside a single-member California LLC that PersonalTokenNet spins up automatically once you have raised more than $250,000. Until that point you issue tokens in your own name; after the threshold, the LLC steps in as the legal “issuer” while PersonalTokenNet handles all the filings and bookkeeping behind the scenes.
The Agreement also builds a protective wall: except in the extreme case where a court decides you lied on purpose, investors can never chase your salary, your car or your savings account. Their only recourse is the token itself and whatever sits in the LLC wallet. PersonalTokenNet gets strictly limited access to confirm the math—once a year it can inspect the capital-gains pages of your tax return, with everything else blacked out, to be sure the sweep was correct. Disputes go to arbitration, California law applies, electronic signatures count, and if PersonalTokenNet ever needs to upgrade the smart contract or the LLC shell, the Agreement travels with it automatically.
In short, the Token Purchase Agreement turns a personal token into a legally solid, investor-ready instrument: clear upside for the buyer, predictable obligations for you, and a safety net that keeps your personal life safely walled off from routine business risk.

## Questions

### Why dilution?

Dilutive issuance maximizes deployable capital, minimizes tax drag, and signals long-term commitment to every new investor.

---

### Shareholder voting rights?

Can personal token shareholders vote on the actions of the personal token owner?
Absolutely not. Personal token shareholders **don't vote on anything**, and have no direct say in the actions of the personal token owner. A shareholder is simply a helpful sideline participant in the journey of the personal token owner.

---

### How is valuation determined?

Part convention. Part art. Part science.
There is no set way to value a personal token, which is precisely why you need a market to approximate the value of a personal token.
Fundamentally, how much someone values a personal token is based on how much they believe in the potential of the owner of the personal token (as defined by the value of the equities they will hold in the future in companies and other personal tokens).
How much we value something is driven predominantly by our emotions. This is why you'll notice that when many people value a personal token highly, their optimism spreads to others like an infectious disease, driving up the value of the personal token even further.
Especially early in a personal token owner's life,

### Is income also distributed to shareholders?

NO. Personal tokens don't touch income or any other personal assets. The only assets a personal token represents is your equities in companies and other personal tokens.
Your personal token shareholders **only** receive dividends when you sell equity in a company / personal token.
Your income is **never** touched.
