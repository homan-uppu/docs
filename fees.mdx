There are three types of fees that are possible when transacting on the Net:

1. **Gas fee**: a nominal amount (usually a few dollars) to facilitate a transaction in the Network.
2. **Secondary sale transaction fee**: occurs when a shareholder sells their equity in a personal token.
3. **Equity fee**: occurs when a shareholder raises capital through a fundraising round.

### Secondary sale transaction fee

A royalty fee of (2%) is automatically collected from the transaction value. This fee is split between the token owner (1.5%) and the Network (0.5%). This royalty structure creates an incentive for token owners to approve secondary sales, providing liquidity for early investors while generating ongoing returns for token owners as their personal token gains popularity in the secondary market.

For example: an investor purchased 100,000 shares of your personal token at 2 USD per share (200,000 USD total) during your fundraising round three years ago. Now, they wish to sell 50,000 shares at 5 USD per share (250,000 USD total) through a Secondary Sale Request. If you exercise your right of first refusal, you would pay 250,000 USD to reacquire these shares. If you decline, your existing shareholders have 7 days to purchase these shares. Assuming the sale completes at the 5 USD price, a 2% fee (5,000 USD) would be charged, with 3,750 USD (1.5%) going to you as the token owner and 1,250 USD (0.5%) going to the Network. The seller would receive 245,000 USD, and the buyer would receive 50,000 shares.

### Equity fee

Every time an individual raises funds through their personal token on the Net, a modest fraction of newly issued shares—just 0.1%—is automatically allocated to the [Network Token](/network-token). In practice, this means the Network Token continuously accumulates micro-stakes across the entire ecosystem of personal tokens.
