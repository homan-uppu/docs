When you use the Network, three types of transaction fees apply:

1. **Gas fee**: a nominal amount (usually a few dollars) to facilitate the transaction in the Network.
2. **Secondary sales fee**: a 2% fee on secondary market transactions, split between token owners (1.5%) and the Network (0.5%).
3. **Equity fee**: a small equity stake in the personal token (0.1%) is given to the Network for each fundraising round.

To facilitate the secondary sales and equity fees, we have a [Network Token](/docs/network-token). The Network Token is similar to other personal tokens except that:

1. It's not tied to any individual user, but rather to the Network itself.
2. It represents ownership in an index of all personal tokens in the ecosystem.

Whenever equity in a personal token is sold through a fundraising event, the 0.1% equity stake is automatically granted to the Network Token. Therefore, the more fundraising rounds for a personal token, the greater the Network token's equity in that personal token.
