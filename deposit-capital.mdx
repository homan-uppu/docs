title: Deposit Capital (USDC)
---

Getting money into your PersonalTokenNet wallet is as simple as funding any other USDC-compatible address—think of it as topping up an exchange account.

### 1. Grab your wallet address

In your dashboard you'll see a “Deposit USDC” panel. Copy the address shown there; it is a standard ERC-20 address that lives on the same chain the Net runs on.

### 2. Choose an on-ramp

Already have USDC? Send it directly from any self-custody wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet) or exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini).

Need to buy USDC with dollars? Use an integrated fiat on-ramp (Ramp Network or Stripe on-ramp) or buy on a major exchange, then withdraw to the address from Step 1.

### 3. Make the transfer

Select the same network PTN uses (Ethereum Mainnet during early access).

Paste the address, pick an amount, and confirm.

The dashboard marks the deposit as “Pending” while we wait for 3 block confirmations, then credits your personal-token wallet automatically.

**Heads-up on fees**: You pay the normal gas fee to move USDC on-chain; PTN charges nothing to accept a deposit.
