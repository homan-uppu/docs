Your identity and financial details are locked in an encrypted vault; the chain sees only anonymous math. You can share granular slices (or cryptographic yes/no proofs) with whomever you trust, and revoke that access just as easily.

Regulation requires us to know who you are (KYC) and to file Form D/Blue-Sky notices when you raise capital. What we file lists the issuer (you or your LLC) and the dollar amountâ€”information that is already public record at the SEC. We never disclose your wallet address or personal-token valuation in those filings.

The Net remains auditable and compliant, while your privacy stays in your hands.
